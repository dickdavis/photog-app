## About
This project is a platform for session photographers written in Ruby. You can use this platform to manage clients, book sessions, publish blog posts, maintain portfolio, and provide deliverables to clients through galleries.

## Getting Started
### Installation
To install, fork the repo and execute:

```
git clone [YOUR REPO URL HERE]
cd photog-app
bundle
```

Then, create the `.env` file and enable user signup.

```
ALLOW_SIGNUP=true
```

Create the database and run the migrations (note: you must have `postgresql` installed on your local machine.)

```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```

To signup, fire up the server and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/sign_up` (the link is not displayed anywhere, so you'll need to manually enter the URL any time you need to signup a user). You can disable signup through the `.env` file in your development environment or through the `ALLOW_SIGNUP` environment variable in your production environment.


### Usage
Usage instructions will be published as features are rolled out.

## Contributing
### Code Style
To keep a consistent code style, it is recommended to use
[rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop). If you use `vim` and
[syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic), you
can use `rubocop` as a Ruby checker. To manually run `rubocop`, you
can run the following commands:

```
# Run rubocop for the entire project
bundle exec rubocop
# Run rubocop for a specific file
bundle exec rubocop foo/bar.rb
```

### Documentation

Documentation can be generated using custom rake task. For more information on RDoc, go
[here](https://rdoc.github.io/rdoc/index.html).

```
# Run custom rake task to regenerate RDoc documentation
rake rdoc
```

### Testing
Integration tests should be written for all classes and methods. The test suite
can be run manually `bundle exec rake test`.
